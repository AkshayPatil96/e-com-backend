Here’s the proper sequence for adding core entities in your e-commerce platform:

User
(Create admin/seller accounts first, so you have someone to own/manage products.)

Brand
(Brands are often referenced by products and categories.)

Category
(Products must belong to a category.)

Seller
(If your platform supports multiple sellers, add them before products.)

Product
(Products reference brand, category, and seller.)

Variation
(Variations—like size/color—are always linked to a product.)


=================================================================

Who Should Add What?
1. Categories & Brands
Who: Only admin or superadmin
Why:
Keeps taxonomy clean and avoids duplicates.
Sellers should only select from existing categories/brands.
2. Products
Who:
Sellers: Can add and manage their own products (but only in approved categories/brands).
Admin/Superadmin: Can add, edit, or remove any product (for moderation, featured products, or in case of B2C/own-brand sales).
3. Variations (SKUs)
Who:
Sellers: For their own products.
Admin/Superadmin: For any product (for corrections or bulk uploads).
4. Orders
Who:
Users: Place orders.
Sellers: See/manage orders for their products.
Admin/Superadmin: View all orders, manage disputes, refunds, etc.
5. Users
Who:
Self-registration: For customers and sellers.
Admin/Superadmin: Can create admin accounts, approve sellers, or manage users.
6. Admins
Who:
Superadmin: Can create admins and other superadmins (if you allow).
Admin: Can create other admins only if permissions.admins.canCreate: true.
Portfolio Project Tips (for 3+ Years Experience):
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):
Implement middleware to enforce these permissions at the API level.
Audit Trails:
Log who created/edited/deleted what (great for admin panels and interviews).
Approval Flows:
Optionally, products added by sellers require admin approval before going live.
Soft Deletes:
Use isDeleted for all major entities.
Bulk Operations:
Allow admins to bulk import/export products/categories.
Activity Logs:
Show recent actions in the admin dashboard.
API Documentation:
Use Swagger/OpenAPI for your endpoints.
Testing:
Add unit/integration tests for permission logic and critical flows.
